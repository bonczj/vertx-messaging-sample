= Vert.x Messaging Sample - REST API Verticle project

This project is a REST API that can be invoked by external sources. The message will emit several
events on the Vert.x EventBus. The events will be processed asynchronously. To prevent a blocking
API from running forever, the invoking API will return an ID that can be used to check the status
and results.

= REST API

== POST /api/:type
Send a REST API to run logic against a particular type. An event will be emitted to process this type.
Returns an ID to check the status/results.

== GET /api/:id
Retrieve the current status for the given ID. If the process has completed, then the results will
be included as well.
